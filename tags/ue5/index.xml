      <description>The Modern Sponza rendered in Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen The original Sponza scene is a classic in the field of computer graphics research. Originally created by Crytek for use in CRYENGINE for testing rendering features it was quickly adopted by the community making appearances in several academic papers and CG experiments. The original scene can still be downloading from the CRYENGINE Marketplace and, to this day, it is an amazing piece of graphics to look at.</description>

      <description>In Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s terminology, a Data Asset is an asset that stores, guess what, data. It can be used, for example, to decouple the configuration from behaviour.
Data Assets in Unreal Engine all inherit from the UDataAsset. You can define a new Data Asset type by inheriting from UDataAsset and then your new data asset will become available in the Pick Data Asset Class Dialog:
I&amp;rsquo;m used to create new data assets using C++, you inherit from UDataAsset, add some members with UPROPERTY and done, however, recently I wanted to create one using only Blueprints.</description>
